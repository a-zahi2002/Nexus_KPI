   - Total points (auto-calculated)
   - Timestamps

2. **contributions** - Contribution records
   - UUID primary key

   - Points awarded
   - Avenue/category
   - Added by (user reference)
   - Timestamp

   - Linked member reference
   - Timestamp

### Security Features

## Key Workflows Implemented

### 1. Member Lookup & Registration
```
Search Reg No → If Found: Show Profile → Add Contribution
              → If Not Found: Register New Member
```

### 2. Contribution Tracking
```
Select Member → Add Contribution Form → Enter Details → Auto-calculate Points → Update Leaderboard
```

### 3. User Management
```
Super Admin → Create User → Set Role → Link to Member → User Can Login
```

### 4. Advanced Reporting
```
Apply Filters (Date, Faculty, Projects) → View Results → Export to CSV
```

## Critical Implementation Details

### User-Member Linking

The system **critically** links app users (board members) to their member records:

1. When creating a user, Super Admin selects their member record
2. `app_users.linked_member_reg_no` references `members.reg_no`
3. This allows board members to accumulate points for their own work
4. Ensures integrity between system users and Leo Club members

### Automatic Points Calculation

Points are recalculated automatically via PostgreSQL triggers:

- When contribution added: Update member's total_points
- When contribution updated: Recalculate affected member(s)
- When contribution deleted: Subtract from member's total
- Trigger runs server-side for data integrity

### Photo Upload Flow

1. User selects image file
2. Preview shown using FileReader
3. On form submit, upload to Supabase Storage
4. Store public URL in member record
5. Display circular avatar throughout app
6. Fallback to initials if no photo

## Design System

### Colors
- **Maroon** (#800000): Primary brand color
- **Gold** (#FFD700): Accent for achievements
- **Slate/Gray**: Neutral backgrounds
- Full dark mode support

### Typography
